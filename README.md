# Multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of a Multi-Player, on-line version of Rock Paper Scissors, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. This was a particularly challenging assignment and the code is currently incomplete.

## How to get started with the game
You can play the game online at GitHub Pages eventually, but it's not yet ready. Currently, the two opponents need to share a browser window, which sort of spoils the fun.

## Authors
This game is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
